                    Thanks for taking your time on reading my portfolio! My name is Carlos, and I'm currently on the path to becoming a Web Developer.
                    It's been an incredible journey so far learning about the new technologies that has been implemented throughout the years in the field of Web Development.
                    I am looking forward to improving my knowledge on the latest technologies and adding it to my skill-sets. As a freelance photographer and working with multiple editing softwares
                    on my computer this full-stack course has brought many new ideas in which i would love to achieve in the near future. One of the ideas that i've stumbled upon is creating my own 
                    peronal photography page with my work including photos of events i've photgraphed. It's has been one of my passions for six years and counting, along with music (Bass player).
